# Partial Execution Feature Gap Analysis: N8N vs BudFlow

## N8N Partial Execution Features (from architecture analysis)

### 1. **Advanced Execution Features**
- **Directed Graph**: Uses directed graph representation for optimal execution order
- **Find Start Nodes**: Sophisticated detection of execution starting points
- **Recreate Node Execution Stack**: Advanced execution resume logic
- **Clean Run Data**: Execution data cleanup utilities

### 2. **Execution Context Management**
- **Multiple Context Types**: execute, trigger, webhook, poll, hook contexts
- **Context Switching**: Different execution modes for different node types
- **Execution State Preservation**: Complex state management during execution

### 3. **Data Flow Management**
- **Paired Item Tracking**: Maintains data lineage through transformations
- **Expression Evaluation**: Advanced JavaScript expression engine with $node, $input, $json variables
- **Workflow Data Proxy**: Data access proxy for complex data manipulation
- **Binary Data Handling**: Sophisticated binary data management

### 4. **Execution Control**
- **Waiting Executions**: Support for nodes that wait for external events
- **Execution Resume**: Ability to resume interrupted executions
- **Partial Execution v2**: Advanced algorithm for partial workflow execution
- **Node Dependencies**: Complex dependency resolution and execution ordering

## Current BudFlow Implementation Gaps

### Critical Missing Features:
1. **No Directed Graph Algorithm** - Using simple queue-based execution
2. **No Execution Resume Logic** - Cannot resume from interruption points
3. **No Wait Node Support** - No support for pausing/waiting nodes
4. **Limited Expression Engine** - No $node, $input, $json variable support
5. **No Paired Item Tracking** - Simple data flow without lineage
6. **No Advanced Context Types** - Single execution context only
7. **No Binary Data Integration** - Binary data not integrated with execution
8. **No Execution Data Cleanup** - No cleanup utilities for execution data

### Implementation Priority:
1. **Directed Graph Execution** (Critical)
2. **Advanced Expression Engine** (Critical) 
3. **Execution Resume/Wait Support** (High)
4. **Paired Item Tracking** (High)
5. **Advanced Context Management** (Medium)
6. **Binary Data Integration** (Medium)

## Required Implementation Plan

To achieve full N8N parity, we need to implement:

1. **DirectedGraphExecution**: Proper topological sorting and execution order
2. **AdvancedExpressionEngine**: Full JavaScript compatibility with N8N variables
3. **ExecutionResume**: Ability to pause and resume executions
4. **WaitingExecutions**: Support for wait nodes and external triggers
5. **PairedItemTracking**: Data lineage and transformation tracking
6. **AdvancedExecutionContexts**: Multiple context types for different execution modes
7. **ExecutionDataCleanup**: Proper cleanup and memory management
8. **BinaryDataIntegration**: Full binary data support in execution engine
