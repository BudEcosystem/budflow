# BudFlow Python - Features To Be Implemented

This document provides a comprehensive list of features, components, and improvements that need to be implemented in BudFlow Python to achieve full n8n feature parity and beyond.

## Important: Python-First Implementation

BudFlow Python is a **pure Python implementation** that does not depend on Node.js, TypeScript, or any JavaScript runtime. All features listed in this document must be implemented using Python libraries and frameworks. Where n8n uses Node.js-specific technologies (like Bull for queues), we use Python equivalents (like Celery). This ensures:

- **Native Python performance** without cross-runtime overhead
- **Simplified deployment** with standard Python tooling
- **Better integration** with Python data science and AI ecosystems
- **Consistent developer experience** for Python teams
